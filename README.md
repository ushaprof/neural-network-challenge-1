This repository explains how to build a machine learning model that can predict student loan repayments based on financial data analysis.

# Student Loan Repayment Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of a borrower repaying their student loan. The goal of this project is to build an accurate model using a dataset containing historical information about previous student loan recipients. By predicting whether a borrower will repay their loan, the company can provide more accurate interest rates tailored to the borrower's profile.

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate the probability of loan repayment for a given borrower. We are provided with a CSV dataset containing information about previous loan recipients. The features in the dataset will be used to train a model that predicts whether a new borrower will repay their loan. 

The model will output a probability score indicating the likelihood that the borrower will repay the loan. This will allow the business to adjust interest rates based on risk, providing a better financial product to the customer while minimizing risk for the company.

## Dataset

The CSV file provided by the business team contains the following key features:

- **Credit Ranking**: Numerical representation of the borrower’s credit score.
- **Income**: The borrower’s annual income.
- **Loan Amount**: The total loan amount requested by the borrower.
- **Employment Status**: The borrower’s current employment status (e.g., employed, unemployed).
- **Debt-to-Income Ratio**: Ratio of the borrower’s debt relative to their income.
- **Repayment History**: Whether the borrower has a history of repaying loans (binary value).
- **Education Level**: Education level of the borrower.
- **Age**: The borrower’s age.
- **Other Demographic Information**: Additional relevant features about the borrower’s background.

The target variable is whether the borrower repaid their loan (binary: 1 for repaid, 0 for not repaid).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the neural network model.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and exploratory data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and experimentation.

## Model Building

The project will follow these general steps discussed in class to build the model:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features, and splitting the data into training and test sets.
   
2. **Model Selection**: Try different machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, to find the most suitable one for predicting loan repayment.

3. **Training the Model**: Use the training data to train the selected model(s). Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve performance.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

5. **Model Interpretability**: Interpret the model's predictions and provide insights into which features are most important for predicting loan repayment.

## Future Improvements

Feature Engineering: Additional features or transformations may be added to improve model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameters can be tuned further using methods like grid search or random search to improve accuracy.
Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) could lead to better performance.
Deep Learning Models: Neural networks could be explored further by experimenting with more complex architectures.
